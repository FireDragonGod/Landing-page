# Landing-page

In online marketing, a landing page, sometimes known as a "lead capture page", "single property page", "static page", "squeeze page" or a "destination page", is a single web page that appears in response to clicking on a search engine optimized search result, marketing promotion, marketing email or an online advertisement. See More on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_page). 

The skills I demonstrated here are structuring HTML elements, linking them to CSS and telling CSS what to style every section, and committing every time I make meaningful code change. The images in this current directory I uploaded here act as a guide for me to style the elements.
